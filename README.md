# TerraKubeSphere III: MultiCloud Connections with Terraform

_At the end of this README, you can find the VideoTutorial._

## Introduction.
<div align="justify"> 
In this project example, we are going to walk through the details of how we set up multi-cloud 
network using site-to-site VPN connections in Terraform across Azure, AWS and GCP.
Terraform is an excellent tool for managing cloud infrastructure, enabling engineers to define 
desired configurations in a declarative code format that can be version controlled. While AWS, 
Google Cloud, and Azure offer similar services, they are typically confined to their own cloud 
environments. In contrast, Terraform's support for various cloud providers (and others) makes 
it an ideal option for a multi-cloud architecture.

### Disclaimer.

I created this document with the objective of documenting the tests I 
conducted while attempting to implement this architectural solution during the last few months 
of the master's program. I encountered various failures and made many code changes, so the 
code in this document may not be up to date or may contain errors. My intention is to continue 
working on it in the future and deliver a fully finished and updated version. Nevertheless, I 
found this solution extremely interesting and a way to unify the three clouds that I learned 
about in the master's program, which is why I wanted to share it in case it is also of interest to 
someone else who may want to contribute and help complete it correctly or simply see how we 
could implement this solution.

### Design.
<div align="justify"> 
Since AWS is where our shared private resources reside, it will serve as a hub. We can peer 
other VPCs in AWS with this hub VPC to get access to the private resources, and site-to-site 
VPNs will connect the other clouds to this AWS hub VPC.
Note that each site-to-site VPN connection has two VPN tunnels configured for high 
availability. AWS will also host DNS that other clouds can access to resolve AWS private 
hostnames. For this, weâ€™ll use AWS Simple AD. This works for the configuration described 
here, but for more complicated networks, you may need to run your own DNS. The resulting 
network looks like this:

## Objectives.

1. Set Up Multi-Cloud Network Architecture
- Design and implement a multi-cloud network architecture using Terraform to  establish seamless connectivity between AWS, Azure, and GCP.
- Configure AWS as the central hub for shared private resources and establish  peering with other AWS VPCs for resource access.
2. Establish Secure Site-to-Site VPN Connections
- Configure site-to-site VPN connections between AWS and Azure, and AWS and GCP, ensuring each connection has dual VPN tunnels for high availability.
- Implement necessary security measures to safeguard the data transmitted across 
these VPN connections.
3. Automate Infrastructure Management with Terraform
- Utilize Terraform to define the infrastructure as code (IaC), allowing for version-controlled, repeatable deployments of the multi-cloud environment.
- Ensure that Terraform scripts are modular and reusable for future expansions or modifications of the network architecture.
4. Implement DNS Resolution Across Clouds
- Set up AWS Simple AD to manage DNS, enabling Azure and GCP to resolve private hostnames within the AWS environment.
- Ensure the DNS configuration supports high availability and is scalable to accommodate more complex network setups if needed.
5. Validate and Test Network Connectivity
- Perform thorough testing of the VPN connections to verify that all traffic between the different cloud environments is correctly routed and secure.
- Validate the DNS resolution from Azure and GCP to AWS resources to ensure 
seamless service discovery.
6. Document the Infrastructure and Configuration
- Provide comprehensive documentation for the entire setup process, including  network diagrams, Terraform code explanations, and configuration details.
- Include troubleshooting guides and best practices for maintaining the multicloud network architecture.
7. Ensure High Availability and Redundancy
- Design the network to ensure high availability and redundancy, minimizing the risk of single points of failure.
- Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect and respond to any issues in the VPN connections or DNS resolution promptly.

By achieving these objectives, the project will demonstrate the effective use of Terraform for managing a complex multi-cloud network setup, ensuring secure, reliable, and scalable connectivity between AWS, Azure, and GCP.
